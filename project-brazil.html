<h3 class="modal-section-title">Project Overview</h3>
<p>
    As part of my AI4EO module during my MSc, I undertook a 3-week research project investigating whether satellite data 
    could be used alongside sparse ground-based observations to predict monthly groundwater storage changes in the Amazon 
    basin. With a personal connection to Brazil through my father and a research interest in water sustainability, this 
    proof-of-concept project explored the potential for satellite-based groundwater monitoring in remote, data-scarce regions.
</p>
<p>
    The project developed a machine learning framework to predict month-on-month groundwater level changes 
    using GRACE-derived regional water storage, GLDAS land surface model components, and Sentinel-1 radar backscatter. 
    Despite limited spatial coverage (only 4 wells) and temporal extent (2019 only), the approach achieved strong predictive 
    performance (R² = 0.82), demonstrating the viability of satellite-based groundwater monitoring in tropical regions where 
    traditional well networks are sparse.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Core Challenge: Data Scarcity</h3>
<p>
    Due to the remoteness of the study region, only <strong>four wells</strong> provided monthly groundwater change data for 
    2019. This sparse spatial coverage made interpolation across the region unreliable, requiring a point-based approach that 
    averaged measurements. While this represented a significant spatial simplification given the Amazon's heterogeneity, it 
    was deemed suitable for establishing proof-of-concept relationships between satellite observations and ground-based 
    measurements in this densely forested environment given my lack of available time as well.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Methodology</h3>

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Groundwater Isolation from GRACE/GLDAS</h4>
<p>
    GRACE provides monthly Total Water Storage (TWS) anomalies, representing all water stored on and beneath the land surface 
    (groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, canopy water). To isolate groundwater storage, I subtracted GLDAS-modeled 
    surface components (soil moisture at multiple depths, snow water equivalent, canopy water) from GRACE TWS anomalies:
</p>
<p style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 10px; border-left: 3px solid #4CAF50; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; margin-left: 20px;">
    GWSA = TWS - (Soil Moisture + Snow Water + Canopy Water)
</p>
<p>
    Month-on-month changes in these groundwater storage anomalies were then used as the primary predictive feature.
</p>

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Sentinel-1 Surface Conditions</h4>
<p>
    Sentinel-1 backscatter (VV and VH polarisations) was averaged across the entire region to create point-based values 
    consistent with the well data. These regional averages captured surface conditions related to vegetation and soil moisture 
    dynamics, though the spatial simplification masked the Amazon's enormous heterogeneity. VH polarisation proved particularly 
    valuable for capturing vegetation and surface water signals complementary to GRACE gravity measurements.
</p>

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Seasonal Pattern Capture</h4>
<p>
    Well data analysis revealed clear seasonal cycles: groundwater levels rose during the wet season with a 1-2 month lag 
    (peaking in June), then declined throughout the dry season (reaching minimum in December). Sine and cosine transformations 
    of month were included as features to model these seasonal cycles, with the sine component showing particularly strong 
    correlation (r=0.92) to groundwater changes.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Model Performance & Key Findings</h3>
<p>
    Three models were evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Bayesian Ridge 
    Regression. The <strong>Linear Regression model</strong> achieved the best performance with cross-validation R² of 0.82 
    and MAE of 17.5 ± 13 cm, successfully capturing seasonal dynamics from +80 cm during wet season peaks to -70 cm during 
    dry season troughs.
</p>
<p><strong>Feature importance analysis revealed:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GRACE storage change dominated model performance</strong>, confirming the strong physical relationship between 
    satellite gravity measurements and ground-based observations</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-1 VH backscatter</strong> emerged as the second most important feature, indicating that radar-derived 
    vegetation/surface water signals provide valuable complementary information despite regional averaging</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal patterns</strong> (sine/cosine month transformations) showed strong correlations but contributed 
    moderate additional predictive value beyond GRACE</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Uncertainty quantification through Bayesian Ridge and bootstrap resampling produced prediction intervals of ±22 cm and 
    ±36 cm respectively, with all observed measurements falling within these bounds. The wider bootstrap intervals reflect 
    the additional uncertainty from the limited 12-month dataset, though the model demonstrated strong performance during 
    critical seasonal transition periods.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Conclusions & Future Potential</h3>
<p>
    While constrained by limited spatial coverage and only a single year of observations, the results demonstrate the 
    <strong>strong potential for satellite-based groundwater monitoring in data-scarce tropical regions</strong>. The 
    dominance of GRACE in feature importance validates the physical basis of the approach, while the complementary value 
    of Sentinel-1 suggests multi-sensor fusion can improve predictions beyond gravity measurements alone.
</p>
<p>
    Future work could expand this proof-of-concept by: (1) incorporating expanded well networks and multi-year time series 
    to improve model robustness, (2) utilizing original 10m Sentinel-1 resolution with spatial interpolation of groundwater 
    data to better capture the Amazon's spatial heterogeneity, and (3) exploring the approach in other data-scarce regions 
    where satellite observations could supplement sparse ground networks. This research demonstrates that even with minimal 
    ground truth data, satellite observations can provide valuable insights into groundwater dynamics in remote regions.

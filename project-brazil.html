<h3 class="modal-section-title">Project Overview</h3>
<p>
    As part of my AI4EO module during my MSc, I undertook a 3-week research project investigating whether satellite data 
    could be used alongside ground-based observations to predict monthly groundwater storage changes in the Amazon 
    basin. With a personal connection to Brazil through my father and a research interest in water sustainability, this 
    proof-of-concept project explored the potential for satellite-based groundwater monitoring in remote, data-scarce regions.
</p>
<p>
    I developed a machine learning framework to predict month-on-month groundwater level changes 
    using GRACE-derived regional water storage, GLDAS land surface model components, and Sentinel-1 radar backscatter. 
    Despite limited spatial coverage (only 4 wells) and temporal extent (2019 only due to time constraints), the approach achieved strong predictive 
    performance (R² = 0.82), demonstrating the viability of satellite-based groundwater monitoring in tropical regions where 
    traditional well networks are sparse.

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Core Challenge: Data Scarcity and Time Constraints</h3>
<p>
    Due to the remoteness of the study region, only four wells provided monthly groundwater change data for 
    2019. This sparse spatial coverage made interpolation across the region unreliable, requiring a point-based approach that 
    averaged measurements. While this represented a significant spatial simplification given the Amazon's heterogeneity, it 
    was deemed suitable for establishing proof-of-concept relationships between satellite observations and ground-based 
    measurements in this densely forested environment given my lack of available time.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Methodology</h3>

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Well Data Analysis</h4>
<p>
    The well data represents monthly groundwater level changes, directly measured by the RIMAS monitoring network within Brazilian aquifers. Figure 2 
    illustrates the average month-on-month change in groundwater levels across the 4 wells that fall within my region of interest. It clearly depicts the 
    hydrological cycle, with groundwater levels rosing during the wet season with a 1-2 month lag (peaking in June), then declining throughout the dry season 
    (reaching minimum in December).

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Groundwater Isolation from GRACE/GLDAS</h4>
<p>
    GRACE provides monthly Total Water Storage (TWS) anomalies, representing all water stored on and beneath the land surface 
    (groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, canopy water). To isolate groundwater storage, I subtracted GLDAS-modeled 
    surface components (soil moisture at multiple depths, snow water equivalent, canopy water) from GRACE TWS anomalies:
</p>
<p style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 10px; border-left: 3px solid #4CAF50; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; margin-left: 20px;">
    GWSA = TWS - (Soil Moisture + Snow Water + Canopy Water)
</p>
<p>
    Month-on-month changes in these groundwater storage anomalies were then used as a predictive feature as seen in Figure 3.
</p>

<h4 class="modal-subsection-title">Sentinel-1 Surface Conditions</h4>
<p>
    Sentinel-1 backscatter (VV and VH polarisations) was averaged across the entire region to create point-based values 
    consistent with the well data. These regional averages captured overall surface conditions related to vegetation and soil moisture 
    dynamics, though the spatial simplification masked the Amazon's enormous heterogeneity. VH polarisation proved particularly 
    valuable for capturing vegetation and surface water signals complementary to GRACE gravity measurements.
</p>

<h3 class="modal-section-title">Model Performance & Key Findings</h3>
<p>
    Three models were evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Bayesian Ridge 
    Regression. The <strong>Linear Regression model</strong> achieved the best performance with cross-validation R² of 0.82 
    and MAE of 17.5 ± 13 cm, successfully capturing seasonal dynamics from +80 cm during wet season peaks to -70 cm during 
    dry season troughs.
</p>
<p><strong>Feature importance analysis revealed:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GRACE storage change dominated model performance</strong>, confirming the strong physical relationship between 
    satellite gravity measurements and ground-based observations</li>
    <li><strong>Sentinel-1 VH backscatter</strong> emerged as the second most important feature, indicating that radar-derived 
    vegetation/surface water signals provide valuable complementary information despite regional averaging</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal patterns</strong> (sine/cosine month transformations) showed strong correlations but contributed 
    moderate additional predictive value beyond GRACE</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="modal-section-title">Conclusions & Future Potential</h3>
<p>
    While constrained by limited spatial coverage and only a single year of observations, the results demonstrate the 
    potential for satellite-based groundwater monitoring in data-scarce tropical regions. The 
    dominance of GRACE in feature importance validates the physical basis of the approach, while the complementary value 
    of Sentinel-1 suggests multi-sensor fusion can improve predictions beyond gravity measurements alone.
</p>
<p>
    Future work could expand this proof-of-concept by: (1) incorporating expanded well networks and multi-year time series 
    to improve model robustness, (2) utilising original 10m Sentinel-1 resolution with spatial interpolation of groundwater 
    data to better capture the Amazon's spatial heterogeneity, and (3) exploring the approach in other data-scarce regions 
    where satellite observations could supplement sparse ground networks. This research demonstrates that even with minimal 
    ground truth data, satellite observations can provide valuable insights into groundwater dynamics in remote regions.
